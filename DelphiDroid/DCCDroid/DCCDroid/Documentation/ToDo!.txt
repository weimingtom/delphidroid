Current:

- Support for control properties

- Demo 2: Label, Button, Textbox where you type something into the text box, process a button and the text appear in Label

Backlog:

- Validate program arguments
- Call Delphi compiler to compile before we parse, this make sure that the Delphi compile was successful before we proceed
- TEdit properties/events
- TButton properties/events
- TLabel properties/events 
- TForm properties/events 
- Check how we can handle the height/width of a control where it currently default to "wrap_content"
- Display compile error if you implemented an event handler in Delphi but we don't support it in Android

- Library support: You can write your own library (use MEF)
- Library support: Android.Dailog
- Library support: Android.RESTFul - be able to call a web service
