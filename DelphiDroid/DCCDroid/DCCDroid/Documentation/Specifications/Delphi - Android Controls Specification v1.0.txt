Overview
--------

When writting a Delphi application that target the Android mobile platform you place virtual components on the interface then set properties and 
write the event handlers for example: Place a button (Type: TButton) on the form (Type: TForm), set its Text property to "Ok" then write an OnClick 
event handler.

Because Android controls don't have all the properties/events, we can't map them directly, for now the DCCDroid tool display a error message if a mapping 
can't be done.

Beyond This Scope
-----------------

For now we're going to only do the basic controls, further advance controls will be done at a later stage.

Target Delphi
-------------

Delphi 2006, 2009, 2010 and XE.

Development Required
--------------------

Need to write a set of Android specific controls that map to there Android counterpart but only have the properties/events available that Android have.
For example: Create TDroidButton that is extended from TButton but only expose the Android properties/events. 

All controls should work the same as there Delphi controls e.g. OnClick event of the TButton should work the same as in TDroidButton.

All new controls must be in a Delphi package called "Delphi for Android" and place on the Delphi toolbar as "Droid". 

Delphi -> Android Control Mappings
----------------------------------

This will be provided in an MS Excel sheet.

Develoment Process
------------------

1) Create the new TDroidXXX control (like TDroidButton) together with properties/events.
2) Do testing to make sure all works fine. 
3) Add (Done-1) postfix to Pivotal Tracker task title and assign task back to Lennie De Villiers since need to make the changes as indicated in the topic 
"Tool Changes" below.

Tool Changes
------------

For each control we need to add a mapping for in the DCCDroid C# tool before the tool is complete. 
This task will be done by Lennie De Villiers.
